## QuickBolt
QuickBolt is a World of Warcraft Tailoring addon built specifically to handle the crafting of bolts of cloth easily.

The addon is currently a beta version, so there are still some features missing. **The main functionality is ready to use**.

### Installation instructions
1. Click the green `<>` button
2. Click `Download ZIP`
3. Extract the zip file
4. Rename the `quickbolt-main` folder to `QuickBolt`
5. Move the `QuickBolt` folder into your `_classic_era_/Interface/AddOns` folder

### Features
- Track the amount of cloth you have in your bags
- Craft one, or craft all bolts with a single click
- Swap between cloth types easily
- Keep track of your tailoring skill level (optional show/hide)
- Set the opacity of the main window
- Auto-hide the main window in combat (optional on/off)
- Drag the main window anywhere on your screen
- Automatically disables until you learn Tailoring

### Future additions
- Automatically change the selected cloth type based on what you are looting (optional on/off)
- Settings UI (the same functionality as the available slash commands)

### Known issues
- The one-click crafting does not function until you manually open the Tailoring skill window in your play session
